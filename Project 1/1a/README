Included files
======

lab1a.c contains the main source module, written in C. When run with no options,
it puts the keyboard into non-canonical input mode for the user to interact with.
When run with the --shell option, it forks a child process that executes a shell.
On top of that, it performs operations such as piping between the parent and 
child process, polling input and error events, shutdown processing, etc.

Makefile contains the code to build the program and the tarball in this submission.

README contains an overview of the files and other details included in this project.

Testing methodology
======

Most of the testing in this project was done by a combination of observing the 
output of the program in certain inputs, reading the printed messages from the 
program, and using the gdb debugger along with breakpoints to view the state 
of the program at certain points.
